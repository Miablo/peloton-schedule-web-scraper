To run this code:

  1. You need to edit line 62â€™s string to the location of the ChromeDriver.exe
     file. Note: the ChromeDriver.exe included is for Mac OS X 64 bit. If you
     have a different operating system please download the correct executable here: 
     https://sites.google.com/a/chromium.org/chromedriver/downloads

  2. You need the files: client_secret.json, storage.json in your current working
     directory

  3. The first time you run the file an automated window will appear and ask you to
     authenticate this process. Sign in under your google account. The account you sign
     into will be the account that the calendar is added to.

  4. You will need to add your own .json files
